API Reference
-------------

The basic functions of MIDI jack are provided in the MidiMaster class.

The *channel* arguments in the following functions can be omitted.
In that case, it returns the value from the All-Channel slot, which stores
the mixed status of all available channels.

- MidiMaster.GetKey (channel, noteNumber)
  
  Returns the ststate of a key. If the key is "on", it returns the velocity
  value (more than zero, up to 1.0). If the key is "off", it returns zero.

- MidiMaster.GetKeyDown (channel, noteNumber)

  Returns true during the frame the user starts pressing down the key.

- MidiMaster.GetKeyUp (channel, noteNumber)

  Returns true during the frame the user releases the key.

- MidiMaster.GetKnob (channel, knobNumber, defaultValue)

  Returns the controller value (CC). The value range is 0.0 to 1.0.

- MidiMaster.GetKnobNumbers (channel)

  Returns the list of active controllers.

Current Limitations
-------------------

- Currently MIDI Jack only supports Windows and OS X. No iOS support yet.
- Only supports MIDI in. No MIDI out support yet.
- The MIDI Jack plugin always tries to capture all available MIDI devices.
  On Windows this behavior may conflict with other MIDI applications.
